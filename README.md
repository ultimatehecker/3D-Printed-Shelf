## About The Project
Although this project is entirely practical, and probably wont work in real life due to the limit of 3D printing, it would be nice to get
this working to some degree at some point. Anyways, this shelf has two brackets that are pocketed to reduce the amount of filament used while 
maintaining the strength of the bracket. The top shelf has a specific area of your phone (away from you so you don't use it). There is also a small 
drawer to store small stuff such as a wallet, keys or anything important so it is all in one place. Lastly, the brackets also have a powerstrip mount
to keep it away from bring either on the floor looking messy, or being on the shelf wasting desk space.

## Installation
This brackets are installed using four #7 wood screws of any length. If there aren't any studs to mount it to, then you will need to get the appropiate 
anchors so it doesn't sheer the drywall (for my American people). Once you have that installed, everything else is installed using `M4x0.7` and 
`M3x0.5` screws. All of these are installed using the appropiate heat set inserts to make it easier to print the parts and prevent the use of nuts.
